	* [Can't set ACL on object using the SDK](http://developer.amazonwebservices.com/connect/thread.jspa?threadID=52305)
	* [Range requests for S3 - status codes 200, 206](http://developer.amazonwebservices.com/connect/thread.jspa?threadID=52738)
	* [S3 change_storage_redundancy() function clears public-read ACL](http://developer.amazonwebservices.com/connect/thread.jspa?threadID=52652)


## Base/Runtime class
* **New:** Added support for request retries and exponential backoff for all `500` and `503` HTTP status codes.
* **New:** Added the `enable_debug_mode()` method to enable HTTP request/response header logging to `STDERR`.


## Service Classes
### AmazonS3
* **Fixed:** Lots of tweaks to the documentation.
* **Fixed:** The `change_content_type()`, `change_storage_redundancy()`, `set_object_acl()`, and `update_object()` methods now respect the existing content-type, storage redundancy, and ACL settings when updating.
* **New:** Added the `get_object_metadata()` method has been added as a singular interface for obtaining all available metadata for an object.


## Utility Classes
### CFArray
* **New:** Added the `each()` method which accepts a callback function to execute for each entry in the array. Works similarly to [jQuery's each()](http://api.jquery.com/each).
* **New:** Added the `map()` method which accepts a callback function to execute for each entry in the array. Works similarly to [jQuery's map()](http://api.jquery.com/map).
* **New:** Added the `reduce()` method which accepts a callback function to execute for each entry in the array. Works similarly to [DomCrawler reduce()](http://github.com/symfony/symfony/blob/master/src/Symfony/Component/DomCrawler/Crawler.php) from the [Symfony 2](http://symfony-reloaded.org) Preview Release.
* **New:** Added the `first()` and `last()` methods to return the first and last nodes in the array, respectively.

### CFInfo
* **New:** Retrieves information about the current installation of the AWS SDK for PHP.

* **New:** Added the `parent()` method, which allows for traversing back up the document tree.
* **New:** Added the `stringify()` method, which typecasts the value as a string.
* **New:** Added the `is()` and `contains()` methods, which allow for testing whether the XML value is or contains a given value, respectively.
* **Changed:** Now extends the `SimpleXMLIterator` class, which in-turn extends the `SimpleXMLElement` class. This adds new iterator methods to the `CFSimpleXML` class.


## Third-party Libraries
### CacheCore
* **New:** Upgraded to version 1.2.
* **New:** Added a static `init` method that allows for chainable cache initialization (5.3+).

### RequestCore
* **New:** Added `206` as a successful status code (i.e., Range GET).


## Compatibility Test
* **Fixed:** Some of the links in the compatibility test were missing. These have been fixed.

# Changelog: AWS SDK for PHP 1.0

Launched Tuesday, September 28, 2010

This is a complete list of changes since we forked from the CloudFusion 2.5.x trunk build.


## New Features & Highlights (Summary)
* The new file to include is `sdk.class.php` rather than `cloudfusion.class.php`.
* Because of the increased reliance on [JSON](http://json.org) across AWS services, the minimum supported version is now PHP 5.2 ([Released in November 2006](http://www.php.net/ChangeLog-5.php#5.2.0); Justified by these [WordPress usage statistics](http://wpdevel.wordpress.com/2010/07/09/suggest-topics-for-the-july-15-2010-dev/comment-page-1/#comment-8542) and the fact that [PHP 5.2 has been end-of-life'd](http://www.php.net/archive/2010.php#id2010-07-22-1) in favor of 5.3).
* Up-to-date service support for [EC2](http://aws.amazon.com/ec2), [S3](http://aws.amazon.com/s3), [SQS](http://aws.amazon.com/sqs), [SimpleDB](http://aws.amazon.com/simpledb), [CloudWatch](http://aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch), and [CloudFront](http://aws.amazon.com/cloudfront).
* Added service support for [SNS](http://aws.amazon.com/sns).
* Limited testing for third-party API-compatible services such as [Eucalyptus](http://open.eucalyptus.com), [Walrus](http://open.eucalyptus.com) and [Google Storage](http://sandbox.google.com/storage).
* Improved the consistency of setting complex data types across services. (Required some backwards-incompatible changes.)
* Added new APIs and syntactic sugar for SimpleXML responses, batch requests and response caching.
* Moved away from _global_ constants in favor of _class_ constants.
* Minor, but notable improvements to the monkey patching support.
* Added a complete list of bug fix and patch contributors. Give credit where credit is due. ;)

**Note: ALL backwards-incompatible changes are noted below. Please review the changes if you are upgrading.** We're making a small number of backwards-incompatible changes in order to improve the consistency across services. We're making these changes _now_ so that we can ensure that future versions will always be backwards-compatible with the next major version change.


## File structure
The package file structure has been refined in a few ways:

* All service-specific classes are inside the `/services/` directory.
* All utility-specific classes are inside the `/utilities/` directory.
* All third-party classes are inside the `/lib/` directory.


## Base/Runtime class
* **Fixed:** Resolved issues: [#206](http://code.google.com/p/tarzan-aws/issues/detail?id=206).
* **New:** The following global constants have been added: `CFRUNTIME_NAME`, `CFRUNTIME_VERSION`, `CFRUNTIME_BUILD`, `CFRUNTIME_URL`, and `CFRUNTIME_USERAGENT`
* **New:** Now supports camelCase versions of the snake_case method names. (e.g. `getObjectList()` will get translated to `get_object_list()` behind the scenes.)
* **New:** Added `set_resource_prefix()` and `allow_hostname_override()` (in addition to `set_hostname()`) to support third-party, API-compatible services.
* **New:** Added new caching APIs: `cache()` and `delete_cache()`, which work differently from the methods they replace. See docs for more information.
* **New:** Added new batch request APIs, `batch()` and `CFBatchRequest` which are intended to replace the old `returnCurlHandle` optional parameter.
* **New:** Will look for the `config.inc.php` file first in the same directory (`./config.inc.php`), and then fallback to `~/.aws/sdk/config.inc.php`.
* **Changed:** Renamed the `CloudFusion` base class to `CFRuntime`.
* **Changed:** `CloudFusion_Exception` has been renamed as `CFRuntime_Exception`.
* **Changed:** Renamed the `CloudFusion::$enable_ssl` property to `CFRuntime::$use_ssl`.
* **Changed:** Renamed the `CloudFusion::$set_proxy` property to `CFRuntime::$proxy`.
* **Changed:** `CFRuntime::disable_ssl()` no longer takes any parameters. Once SSL is off, it is always off for that class instance.
* **Changed:** All date-related constants are now class constants of the `CFUtilities` class (e.g. `CFUtilities::DATE_FORMAT_ISO8601`).
	* Use `CFUtilities::konst()` if you're extending classes and need to do something such as `$this->util::DATE_FORMAT_ISO8601` but keep getting the `T_PAAMAYIM_NEKUDOTAYIMM` error.
* **Changed:** All `x-cloudfusion-` and `x-tarzan-` HTTP headers are now `x-aws-`.
* **Changed:** `CloudFusion::autoloader()` is now in its own separate class: `CFLoader::autoloader()`. This prevents it from being incorrectly inherited by extending classes.
* **Changed:** `RequestCore`, `ResponseCore` and `SimpleXMLElement` are now extended by `CFRequest`, `CFResponse` and `CFSimpleXML`, respectively. These new classes are now used by default.
* **Changed:** Changes to monkey patching:
	* You must now extend `CFRequest` instead of `RequestCore`, and then pass that class name to `set_request_class()`.
	* You must now extend `CFResponse` instead of `ResponseCore`, and then pass that class name to `set_response_class()`.
	* You can now monkey patch `CFSimpleXML` (extended from `SimpleXMLElement`) with `set_parser_class()`.
	* You can now monkey patch `CFBatchRequest` with `set_batch_class()`.
	* No changes for monkey patching `CFUtilities` with `set_utilities_class()`.
* **Removed:** Removed ALL existing _global_ constants and replaced them with _class_ constants.
* **Removed:** Removed `cache_response()` and `delete_cache_response()`.

### AmazonS3
* **Fixed:** Resolved issues: [#31](http://code.google.com/p/tarzan-aws/issues/detail?id=31), [#72](http://code.google.com/p/tarzan-aws/issues/detail?id=72), [#123](http://code.google.com/p/tarzan-aws/issues/detail?id=123), [#156](http://code.google.com/p/tarzan-aws/issues/detail?id=156), [#199](http://code.google.com/p/tarzan-aws/issues/detail?id=199), [#201](http://code.google.com/p/tarzan-aws/issues/detail?id=201), [#203](http://code.google.com/p/tarzan-aws/issues/detail?id=203), [#207](http://code.google.com/p/tarzan-aws/issues/detail?id=207), [#208](http://code.google.com/p/tarzan-aws/issues/detail?id=208), [#209](http://code.google.com/p/tarzan-aws/issues/detail?id=209), [#210](http://code.google.com/p/tarzan-aws/issues/detail?id=210), [#212](http://code.google.com/p/tarzan-aws/issues/detail?id=212), [#216](http://code.google.com/p/tarzan-aws/issues/detail?id=216), [#217](http://code.google.com/p/tarzan-aws/issues/detail?id=217), [#226](http://code.google.com/p/tarzan-aws/issues/detail?id=226), [#228](http://code.google.com/p/tarzan-aws/issues/detail?id=228), [#234](http://code.google.com/p/tarzan-aws/issues/detail?id=234), [#235](http://code.google.com/p/tarzan-aws/issues/detail?id=235).
* **Fixed:** Fixed an issue where `AmazonS3` sent a `RequestCore` user agent in requests.
* **New:** Now supports the _Northern California_ and _Asia-Pacific_ regions.
* **New:** Now supports the new _EU (Ireland)_ REST endpoint.
* **New:** Now supports MFA Delete.
* **New:** Now supports Conditional Copy.
* **New:** Now supports Reduced Redundancy Storage (RRS). Added `change_storage_redundancy()`.
* **New:** Now supports Object Versioning. Added `enable_versioning()`, `disable_versioning`, `get_versioning_status()`, and `list_bucket_object_versions()`.
* **New:** Now supports Bucket Policies. Added `set_bucket_policy()`, `get_bucket_policy()`, and `delete_bucket_policy()`.
* **New:** Now supports Bucket Notifications. Added `create_bucket_notification()`, `get_bucket_notifications()`, and `delete_bucket_notification()`.
* **New:** Added _class_ constants for regions: `REGION_US_E1`, `REGION_US_W1`, `REGION_EU_W1`, `REGION_APAC_SE1`.
* **New:** Added _class_ constants for storage types: `STORAGE_STANDARD` and `STORAGE_REDUCED`.
* **New:** Enhanced `create_object()` with the ability to upload a file from the file system.
* **New:** Enhanced `get_object()` with the ability to download a file to the file system.
* **New:** Enhanced `get_bucket_list()` and `get_object_list()` with performance improvements.
* **New:** Enhanced all GET operations with the ability to generate pre-authenticated URLs. This is the same feature as `get_object_url()` has had, applied to all GET operations.
* **New:** Limited testing with Walrus, the Eucalyptus S3-clone.
* **New:** Limited testing with Google Storage.
* **Changed:** Replaced all of the remaining `S3_*` constants with _class_ constants: `self::ACL_*`, `self::GRANT_*`, `self::USERS_*`, and `self::PCRE_ALL`.
* **Changed:** Changed the function signature for `create_object()`. The filename is now passed as the second parameter, while the remaining options are now passed as the third parameter. This behavior now matches all of the other object-related methods.
* **Changed:** Changed the function signature for `head_object()`, `delete_object()`, and `get_object_acl()`. The methods now accept optional parameters as the third parameter instead of simply `returnCurlHandle`.
* **Changed:** Changed the function signature for `get_object_url()` and `get_torrent_url()`. Instead of passing a number of seconds until the URL expires, you now pass a string that `strtotime()` understands (including `60 seconds`).
* **Changed:** Changed the function signature for `get_object_url()`. Instead of passing a boolean value for `$torrent`, the last parameter is now an `$opt` variable which allows you to set `torrent` and `method` parameters.
* **Changed:** Changed how `returnCurlHandle` is used. Instead of passing `true` as the last parameter to most methods, you now need to explicitly set `array('returnCurlHandle' => true)`. This behavior is consistent with the implementation in other classes.
* **Changed:** Optional parameter names changed in `list_objects()`: `maxKeys` is now `max-keys`.
* **Changed:** `get_bucket_locale()` is now called `get_bucket_region()`, and returns the response body as a _string_ for easier comparison with class constants.
* **Changed:** `get_bucket_size()` is now called `get_bucket_object_count()`. Everything else about it is identical.
* **Changed:** `head_bucket()` is now called `get_bucket_headers()`. Everything else about it is identical.
* **Changed:** `head_object()` is now called `get_object_headers()`. Everything else about it is identical.
* **Changed:** `create_bucket()` has two backward-incompatible changes:
	* Method now **requires** the region (formerly _locale_) to be set.
	* Method takes an `$acl` parameter so that the ACL can be set directly when creating a new bucket.
* **Changed:** Bucket names are now validated. Creating a new bucket now requires the more stringent DNS-valid guidelines, while the process of reading existing buckets follows the looser path-style guidelines. This change also means that the reading of path-style bucket names is now supported, when previously they weren’t.
* **Removed:** Removed `store_remote_file()` because its intended usage repeatedly confused users, and had potential for misuse. If you were using it to upload from the local file system, you should be using `create_object` instead.
* **Removed:** Removed `copy_bucket()`, `replace_bucket()`, `duplicate_object()`, `move_object()`, and `rename_object()` because only a small number of users used them, and they weren't very robust anyway.
* **Removed:** Removed `get_bucket()` because it was just an alias for `list_objects()` anyway. Use the latter from now on -- it's identical.

### AmazonSDB
* **Fixed:** Resolved issues: [#205](http://code.google.com/p/tarzan-aws/issues/detail?id=205).
* **New:** Class is now up-to-date with the [2009-04-15](http://docs.amazonwebservices.com/AmazonSimpleDB/2009-04-15/DeveloperGuide/) API release.
* **Changed:** Changed the function signatures for `get_attributes()` and `delete_attributes()` to improve consistency.

### AmazonSNS
* **New:** Up-to-date with the [2010-03-31](http://docs.amazonwebservices.com/sns/2010-03-31/api/) API release.

### AmazonSQS
* **Fixed:** Resolved issues: [#137](http://code.google.com/p/tarzan-aws/issues/detail?id=137), [#213](http://code.google.com/p/tarzan-aws/issues/detail?id=213), [#219](http://code.google.com/p/tarzan-aws/issues/detail?id=219), [#220](http://code.google.com/p/tarzan-aws/issues/detail?id=220), [#221](http://code.google.com/p/tarzan-aws/issues/detail?id=221), [#222](http://code.google.com/p/tarzan-aws/issues/detail?id=222).
* **Fixed:** In CloudFusion 2.5, neither `add_permission()` nor `remove_permission()` were functional. They are now working.
* **New:** Now supports the _Northern California_ and _Asia-Pacific_ regions.
* **New:** Now supports the new _US-East (N. Virginia)_ endpoint.
* **New:** Now supports the new _EU (Ireland)_ endpoint.
* **New:** Added new _class_ constants for regions: `REGION_US_E1`, `REGION_US_W1`, `REGION_EU_W1`, and `REGION_APAC_SE1`.
* **Changed:** Because we now support multiple region endpoints, queue names alone are no longer sufficient for referencing your queues. As such, you must now use a full-queue URL instead of just the queue name.
* **Changed:** The _global_ `SQS_LOCATION_US` and `SQS_LOCATION_EU` constants have been replaced.
* **Changed:** Renamed `set_locale()` as `set_region()`. It accepts any of the region constants.
* **Changed:** Changed the function signature for `list_queues()`. See the updated API reference.
* **Changed:** Changed the function signature for `set_queue_attributes()`. See the updated API reference.
* **Changed:** Changed how `returnCurlHandle` is used. Instead of passing `true` as the last parameter to most methods, you now need to explicitly set `array('returnCurlHandle' => true)`. This behavior is consistent with the implementation in other classes.
* **Changed:** Function signature changed in `get_queue_attributes()`. The `$attribute_name` parameter is now passed as a value in the `$opt` parameter.

### AmazonSQSQueue
* **Removed:** `AmazonSQSQueue` was a simple wrapper around the AmazonSDB class. It generally failed as an object-centric approach to working with SQS, and as such, has been eliminated. Use the `AmazonSQS` class instead.


## Utility Classes
### CFArray
* **New:** Extends `ArrayObject`.
* **New:** Simplified typecasting of SimpleXML nodes to native types (e.g. integers, strings).

### CFBatchRequest
* **New:** Provides a higher-level API for executing batch requests.

### CFComplexType
* **New:** Used internally by several classes to handle various complex data-types (e.g. single or multiple values, `Key.x.Subkey.y.Value` combinations).
* **New:** Introduces a way to convert between JSON, YAML, and the PHP equivalent of Lists and Maps (nested associative arrays).

### CFRequest
* **New:** Sets some project-specific settings and passes them to the lower-level RequestCore.

### CFResponse
* **New:** No additional changes from the base `ResponseCore` class.

### CFPolicy
* **New:** Used for constructing Base64-encoded, JSON policy documents to be passed around to other methods.

### CFSimpleXML
* **New:** Extends `SimpleXMLElement`.
* **New:** Simplified node retrieval. All SimpleXML-based objects (e.g. `$response->body`) now have magic methods that allow you to quickly retrieve nodes with the same name
	* e.g. `$response->body->Name()` will return an array of all SimpleXML nodes that match the `//Name` XPath expression.

### CFUtilities
* **Fixed:** `to_query_string()` now explicitly passes a `&` character to `http_build_query()` to avoid configuration issues with MAMP/WAMP/XAMP installations.
* **Fixed:** `convert_response_to_array()` has been fixed to correctly return an all-array response under both PHP 5.2 and 5.3. Previously, PHP 5.3 returned a mix of `array`s and `stdClass` objects.
* **New:** Added `konst()` to retrieve the value of a class constant, while avoiding the `T_PAAMAYIM_NEKUDOTAYIM` error. Misspelled because `const` is a reserved word.
* **New:** Added `is_base64()` to determine whether or not a string is Base64-encoded data.
* **New:** Added `decode_uhex()` to decode `\uXXXX` entities back into their unicode equivalents.
* **Changed:** Changed `size_readable()`. Now supports units up to exabytes.
* **Changed:** Moved the `DATE_FORMAT_*` _global_ constants into this class as _class_ constants.
* **Removed:** Removed `json_encode_php51()` now that the minimum required version is PHP 5.2 (which includes the JSON extension by default).
* **Removed:** Removed `hex_to_base64()`.


## Third-party Libraries
### CacheCore
* **New:** Upgraded to version 1.1.1.
* **New:** Now supports both the [memcache](http://php.net/memcache) extension, but also the newer, faster [memcached](http://php.net/memcached) extension. Prefers `memcached` if both are installed.
* **Deprecated:** Support for MySQL and PostgreSQL as storage mechanisms has been **deprecated**. Since they're using PDO, they'll continue to function (as we're maintaining SQLite support via PDO), but we recommend migrating to using APC, XCache, Memcache or SQLite if you'd like to continue using response caching.
* New BSD licensed
* <http://github.com/skyzyx/cachecore>

### RequestCore
* **New:** Upgraded to version 1.2.
* **New:** Now supports streaming up and down.
* **New:** Now supports "rolling" requests for better scalability.
* New BSD licensed
* <http://github.com/skyzyx/requestcore>
