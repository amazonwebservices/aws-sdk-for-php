// SETUP

	// Enable full-blown error reporting. http://twitter.com/rasmus/status/7448448829
	error_reporting(-1);

	// Set HTML headers
	header("Content-type: text/html; charset=utf-8");

	// Include the SDK
	require_once '../sdk.class.php';

// THE GOALS & PREPARATION

	/*
		1. The goal of this exercise is to retrieve a list of all image IDs that are prefixed with "aki-".
		2. We should end up with an indexed array of string values (just the image IDs).
	*/

	// Instantiate the AmazonEC2 class
	$ec2 = new AmazonEC2();

	// Get the response from a call to the DescribeImages operation.
	$response = $ec2->describe_images();


/*%******************************************************************************************%*/
// THE LONG WAY

	// Prepare to collect AKIs.
	$akis = array();

	// Loop through the response...
	foreach ($response->body->imagesSet->item as $item)
	{
		// Stringify the value
		$image_id = (string) $item->imageId;

		// Filter the value against a PCRE regular expression.
		if (preg_match('/aki/i', $image_id))
		{
			// If the name matches our pattern, add it to the list.
			$akis[] = $image_id;
		}
	}

	// Display
	print_r($akis);


/*%******************************************************************************************%*/
// THE SHORT WAY

	// Look through the body, grab ALL <imageId> nodes, stringify the values, and filter them with the
	// PCRE regular expression.
	$akis = $response->body->imageId()->map_string('/aki/i');

	// Display
	print_r($akis);
